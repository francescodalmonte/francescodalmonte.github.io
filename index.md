# ciao! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student at the Physics Department of [Bologna University](https://www.unibo.it/en/homepage), co-supervised by Prof. Nico Lanconelli and Dott. Davide Collini (Diemme Filtration srl - Aqseptence Group). My research work is mostly focused on Deep Learning-based applications for Computer Vision and image analysis.

Before starting my PhD, I earned a Master's Degree in Applied Physics at the Bologna University, with an [experimental thesis](https://amslaurea.unibo.it/26248/) on graph-based approaches for Brain rs-fMRI signal analysis.
